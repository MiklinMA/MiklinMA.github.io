# My backlog

### Beginning

I started my way into IT while I was a student. It was interesting for me to study new technologies and immediately apply them in practice, so I started working on small projects in parallel and soon got a full-time job. I started with the introduction of software in government structures, then I was a system administrator of the regional data processing center, and simultaneously developed a system for registering applications (bugtracker for civil servants) in C++/Qt and MySQL, which is still works to this day. I moved to Tyumen to work as a 1C programmer, then registered as enterpreneur and did projects in Python, C++, PHP, Java. I was always interested in doing something new, creating something useful.

### Management

A few years later, I was promoted to the manager of the CRM project, and then to the head of the information technology service. But, in addition to the new duties, I continued to program myself. Several small projects and one large - a contact center and a front office. Python, C++, Asterisk, WebRTC, Websockets, ORM, multithreading, event logic, etc.

Also with my team I automated (practically) all the business processes of the company (auto show, car service, spare parts order, logistics, trade-in). For this, the 1C platform was used for integration with many external systems. I know how to work in a team, understand the goals of the company and I can create a product from the idea born in the discussion. I have many times faced with changes in the requirements for the project and I understand that in business it is inevitable. I studied the technology of continuous integration, I managed to implement this approach to a small extent in my company and I would like to work with it.

### Further

A few months, I work with foreign customers on UpWork. The experience is small, but I already managed to participate in several projects with guys from India, Pakistan and the United States.

Recently I started to study GoLang, NodeJS and React. I also have an interest in the message queues (RabbitMQ and Nats) and microservices. I have a small project that connects Nats to GoLang, Python and C++.

### Frankly

But, in this hectic, I lost what I love. I love to create something new, learn something new, discover something new for myself. So I decided to resign from the position of the head of the service and continue to do what I love to do. Programming and launching new projects. Now I'm working with UpWork, but I'm looking for interesting jobs around the world.

I love running and walking. 

In my spare time I am engaged in rugby and martial arts.
